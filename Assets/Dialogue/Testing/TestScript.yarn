Deckname: Fisherman, fisher of men. Give this man a fish of wisdom so that he may think for a day. //#line:detective-1-e-2 // dubious 
Fisherman: I fish where I am, and I fish where I swam.
    -> Catch anything?
        Deckname: Catch anything?
        Fisherman: The water used to have crappie. Now it's just full of crap and pee. 
    -> You swam in this filth?
        Deckname: You swam in this filth?
        Fisherman: Decades ago. Before everything went to shit. 
Fisherman: This city used to be a beautiful place. Then Hermetica Solutions bought the whole damn thing. And that big dam thing over there.
Fisherman: Another one of you robots were talking about bringing change to the city. Then he started swimming in the shit water towards that building so I'm assuming he's dead now.

Boss: Welcome home Detective Deckname. You've can't solve a case without fucking it up, but at least you can do the bare minimum and pass that.
Deckname: Your kindness is a gentle ripple in the ocean of my gratitude, Bossman.
Boss: Shut the fuck up, Deckman. We have a new case for you. An alchemist at Hermetica Labs was killed outside of a McHermetica's. The killer left a manifesto. Adding it to your notes now. 
-> Press tab to view notes.
Boss: Incredibly basic plot setup. You get the deal. Are you up for it?
Deckname: I am a detective: a detector of I'ves. And I've got a premonition- I've got to solve this case.
Boss: I swear to god Deckman, are you drinking on the job again?
Deckname: To drink is to silence the cries within-side you. 
Boss: If you pull one more bullshit philosophical quote out of your ass I'm firing you immediately.
Deckname: But to speak is to cry from the silence without-side you. 
Boss: You're fired. Effective immediately. I'm taking over the case myself. Leave the building and don't come back.
Deckman: What.
Boss: Get the fuck out before I throw you out the god damn window!

Deckname: I got fired. 
Mark: Damn.
Mark: Didn't know I was talking to a jobless loser. Hahahahaha.
Deckname: The cynic in me rejoices at your jest. 
Mark: A robot without a job is worthless though. It's like Hermetica without the beautiful smog. Hahahahaha. 
Mark: I bet it was all the goofy poetic shit you do. I know what will cheer you up. Let's go to a POETRY SLAM!
Deckname: What.
Mark: Poetry slam. It's where they spit straight fire. Makes your soul ignite. You can sit at the back with me. 
Deckname: Maybe. 
Mark: Well it's in the building next to the [INSERT HOLOGRAM HERE] in the Phosphor District if you want to go. 
Mark: There's also a rooftop party at the [INSERT BUILDING HERE] if you want some sun instead. 
Deckname: I need to check the groceries in my fridge first. 
Mark: Okay man. Just don't embarass me.
