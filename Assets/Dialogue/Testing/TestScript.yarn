Deckname: Fisherman, fisher of men. Give this man a fish of wisdom so that he may think for a day. //#line:detective-1-e-2 // dubious 
Fisherman: I fish where I am, and I fish where I swam.
    -> Catch anything?
        Deckname: Catch anything?
        Fisherman: The water used to have crappie. Now it's just full of crap and pee. 
    -> You swam in this filth?
        Deckname: You swam in this filth?
        Fisherman: Decades ago. Before everything went to shit. 
Fisherman: This city used to be a beautiful place. Then Hermetica Solutions bought the whole damn thing. And that big dam thing over there.
Fisherman: Another one of you robots were talking about bringing change to the city. Then he started swimming in the shit water towards that building so I'm assuming he's dead now.

Deckname: To work.

Deckname: Interconnected.
Boss: What is it like to hold the hand of someone you love? Interconnected. 
-> Interconnected.
Deckname: Interconnected.
Boss:  Last night I made hot sweaty love to your ex-wife, Luna. Interconnected. 
-> Interconnected.
Deckname: Interconnected.
Boss: Just wanted to get that off my chest. Interconnected.
-> Interconnected.
Deckname: Interconnected.


Boss: Welcome home Detective Deckname. You've can't solve a case without fucking it up, but at least you can do the bare minimum and pass that.
-> Thanks.
Deckname: Your kindness is a gentle ripple in the ocean of my gratitude, Bossman.
Boss: Shut the fuck up, Deckman. We have a new case for you. An alchemist at Hermetica Labs was killed outside of a McHermetica's. The killer left a manifesto. Adding it to your notes now. 
Boss: Incredibly basic plot setup. You get the deal. Are you up for it?
-> Yes.
Deckname: I am a detective: a detector of I'ves. And I've got a premonition- I've got to solve this case.
Boss: I swear to god Deckman, are you drinking on the job again?
-> No.
Deckname: To drink is to silence the cries within-side you. 
Boss: If you pull one more bullshit philosophical quote out of your ass I'm firing you immediately.
-> Definitely won't.
Deckname: ...but to speak is to cry from the silence without-side you. 
Boss: You're fired. Effective immediately. I'm taking over the case myself. Leave the building and don't come back.
Deckman: What.
Boss: Get the fuck out before I throw you out the god damn window!

Mark: Hey Deckman.
Deckname: I got fired. 
Mark: Damn.
Mark: Didn't know I was talking to a jobless loser. Hahahahaha.
Deckname: The cynic in me rejoices at your jest. 
Mark: A robot without a job is worthless though. It's like Hermetica without the beautiful smog. Hahahahaha. 
Mark: I bet it was all the goofy poetic shit you do. I know what will cheer you up. Let's go to a POETRY SLAM!
Deckname: What.
Mark: Poetry slam. It's where they spit straight fire. Makes your soul ignite. You can sit at the back with me. 
Deckname: Maybe. 
Mark: Well it's in the building next to the [INSERT HOLOGRAM HERE] in the Phosphor District if you want to go. 
Mark: There's also a rooftop party at the [INSERT BUILDING HERE] if you want some sun instead. 
Deckname: I need to check the groceries in my fridge first. 
Mark: Okay man. Just don't embarass me.

Luna: Hello, who is this?
Deckman: Detective Deckman.
Luna: How the fuck did you get this number? 
Deckman: I am a detective: a detector of I'ves. And I've got to know how my beautiful ex-wife is doing.
Luna: Don't call me that. And don't call me at work. And don't ever call me again. 
Phone: ...
Deckman: Chasing her was like trying to catch a shadow in a net. But this net has a tied knot that can't be broken, and a general idea of her current location.

Deckname: The bossman had stripped me bare-took my job, my passion, my very reason for breathing in this smog-choked city.
Deckname: All that was left were my apartment and a mounting tab.
Deckname: In my haze, I'd forgotten the location the one sanctuary I had left. 
Deckname: When guidance seemed lost, I knew my only beacon was that metaphorical TAB button.
Deckname: And now was the time to hit that TAB button. 
Deckname: But I should not hit that TAB button when given options in dialogue, because of unforeseen bugs. 
Deckname: Looking at my TAB, I realized that the bossman had already handed me the case file. And with it, a glimmer of direction. 
Deckname: I could only say one thing after that...
Deckname: I am a detective: a detector of I'ves. And I've got a resolution- I've got to get my job back. And I've got to solve this case.

Boss: Deckname. What the hell are you doing here?
Deckname: I came looking for answers, but I didn't think I'd find a soap opera in full swing.
Deckname: Tell me what you know about the case and I'll just maybe not throw you behind metal bars. 
Luna: GET THE FUCK OUT DECKNAME.
Deckname: In the corner of my eye, I couldn't help but notice a familiar face.
Deckname: Is that you, Luna?
Deckname: You're still as beautiful as the day we met. I've been thinking about you a lot. I miss my wife. I want you to come home. 
Luna: WE WERE NEVER MARRIED. YOU PAID ME TO SUCK YOUR NUTS AND BOLTS ONCE YEARS AGO. I DON'T LOVE YOU AND NEVER WILL. NOW LEAVE ME ALONE!
Deckname: :\\
Bossman: Soooo, do you still want to hear about the case?
