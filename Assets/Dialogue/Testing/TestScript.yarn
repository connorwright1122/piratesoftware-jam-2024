    -> Catch anything?
        Deckname: Catch anything?
        Fisherman: The water used to have crappie. Now it's just full of crap and pee. 
    -> You swam in this filth?
        Deckname: You swam in this filth?
        Fisherman: Decades ago. Before everything went to shit. 
    Fisherman: This city used to be a beautiful place. People used to talk to each other.

Boss: Welcome home Detective Deckname. You've can't solve a case without fucking it up, but at least you can do the bare minimum and pass that.
Deckname: Your kindness is a gentle ripple in the ocean of my gratitude, boss man.
Boss: Shut the fuck up, Deckman. We have a new case for you. An alchemist at Crasis Labs was killed over by the Canals. Incredibly basic plot setup. You get the deal. Are you up for it?
Deckname: I am a detective: a detector of I'ves. And I've got a premonition- I've got to solve this case.
Boss: I swear to god Deckman, are you drinking on the job again?
Deckname: To drink is to silence the cries within-side you. 
Boss: If you pull one more bullshit philosophical quote out of your ass I'm firing you immediately.
Deckname: But to speak is to cry from the silence without-side you. 
Boss: You're fired. Effective immediately. I'm taking over the case myself. Leave the building and don't come back.
Deckman: What
Boss: Get the fuck out before I throw you out the window you worthless piece of junk!
